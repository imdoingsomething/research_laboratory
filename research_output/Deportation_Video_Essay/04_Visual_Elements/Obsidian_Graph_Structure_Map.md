### Graph View Configuration
#### Node Styling
- **Size**: Based on connection count (more connected = larger)
- **Color**: By source type and content category
- **Shape**: Different shapes for different content types
- **Opacity**: Credibility score determines transparency

#### Connection Types
- **Strong Links**: Direct evidence supporting talking points (thick lines)
- **Cross-References**: Related evidence across talking points (dashed lines)
- **Synthesis Links**: Evidence to synthesis documents (dotted lines)
- **Production Links**: Content to video planning materials (colored lines)

### Navigation Workflows

#### Research Review Workflow
1. Start at Main Hub
2. Select talking point of interest
3. Explore connected sources by type
4. Review synthesis documents for integrated analysis
5. Check analytics for quality assessment

#### Video Production Workflow
1. Start at Visual Elements Guide
2. Follow links to relevant talking points
3. Explore evidence synthesis for each segment
4. Review source materials for quotes and visuals
5. Check production planning documents

#### Quality Assurance Workflow
1. Start at Analytics folder
2. Review quality metrics and coverage analysis
3. Follow links to identify strong/weak evidence areas
4. Check completion verification reports
5. Explore cross-references for validation

### Search and Filter Strategies
#### By Content Type
- tag:#legal - All legal sources and analysis
- tag:#policy - Government documents and policy analysis
- tag:#evidence-synthesis - Integrated analysis documents
- tag:#video-production - Production planning materials

#### By Talking Point
- tag:#faceless-justice - Sources supporting anonymity concerns
- tag:#due-process - Constitutional violations evidence
- tag:#fear-freedom - Community impact documentation
- tag:#oversight-blockage - Transparency and accountability issues

#### By Source Quality
- tag:#high-credibility - Government docs, court cases, academic research
- tag:#real-time - News and social media current developments
- tag:#cross-verified - Sources validated across multiple agents

### Visual Clustering Recommendations
- **Constitutional Cluster**: Legal sources and due process materials
- **Policy Implementation Cluster**: Government documents and enforcement directives
- **Community Impact Cluster**: Social research and grassroots documentation
- **Historical Context Cluster**: Precedents and comparative analysis
- **Production Planning Cluster**: Video guides and visual materials
